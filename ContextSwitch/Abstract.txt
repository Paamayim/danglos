Sample context switching implementation for SE350 P1
There are two user processes.
Process p1 prints upper case letters continuously.
Process p2 prints lower case letters continuously.
You will see p1 prints five upper case letters. 
Then p2 starts to print the lower case letters.
Then p1 continues to print another 5 letters and
p2 continue to prints the lower case 5 letters. 
The program never terminates.

The output is through UART0. 
The SIM target has DEBUG_0 compilation flag turned on to show
extra debugging messages. This flag should be turned off
during the demostration since it involves printf function calls.

WARNING:

The example code shows one way of context switching implmentation.
The code only has minimal sanity check. There is no stack overflow check.
The implementation assumes only two simple user processes, NO external interrupts. 
The purpose is to show how context switch could be done under stated assumptions. 
These assumptions are not true in the required RTX Project!!!
If you decide to use this piece of code, you need to understand the assumptions and
the limitations. Some part of the code is not written in the most efficient way.
